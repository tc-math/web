<H2>
FINAL EXAM on Friday, December 12, 2:00 - 5:00 PM. Location TBA.
</H2>
 
<br>


<b>
It is implicit in your registration for this class that, barring some unforeseen calamity,

</b>

<hr>
 

<H3>
GRADING
</H3>

The class grade will be determined as follows:

<br>
<br>

Homework: 25 points

<br>

Exam 1: 25 points

<br>

Exam 2: 25 points

<br>

Final: 50 points

<br>
<br>

The course grade is determined by either dropping the worst in-class exam, or by 
weighing the final exam only with 50% (amounting to 25 points),
whichever yields the better overall grade.
<br>
The maximal total number of points is thus 100.

<br>
<br>

The letter grades are distributed as follows:

<br>
<br>

90 - 100 points: Grade A

<br>

80 - 89 points: Grade B

<br>

70 - 79  points: Grade C

<br>

60 - 69 points: Grade D

<br>

0 - 59 points: Grade F
