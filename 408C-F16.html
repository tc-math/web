<b>Engineering Labs</b> will be held in the following weeks (at the same locations as your TA session): 
<ul>
<li>
Weeks of Aug. 29, Sept. 12, Oct. 17, Oct. 24, and Oct. 31.
</li> 
</ul>
Preparatory modules on <a href="https://quest.cns.utexas.edu/">Quest</a> will be available on the Thursday preceding a Lab week, and are due before 8 AM on the corresponding Monday.

<br>
<br>

The Engineering Labs will be counted towards your HW grade as follows: 
<br>
- You have to complete the preparatory module before the deadline, and 
<br>
- You have to attend to the presentation in the TA session (presence will be taken; you just have to go to your regular TA session room).
<br> 
This earns you 10 points per lab, in the same way as a regular HW assignment. 

<br>

<h3  style="color:#990000">COURSE DESCRIPTION AND PREREQUISITES</h3> 

The syllabus for M408C includes most of the basic topics in the theory of 
functions of a real variable: 
<br>
Algebraic, trigonometric, logarithmic and exponential functions and their limits, continuity, derivatives, maxima and minima, integration, area under a curve, and volumes of revolution.

<br>
<br>

This course carries the <b>Quantitative Reasoning flag</b>. Quantitative Reasoning courses are designed to equip you with skills that are necessary for understanding the types of quantitative arguments you will regularly encounter in your adult and professional life. You should therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from your use of quantitative skills to analyze real-world problems.
 
<br>
<br>

For information on prerequisites, please see 
<a href="https://www.ma.utexas.edu/academics/courses/syllabi/M408C.php">here</a>.

GRADING
</H3>


 


<ul>

 

<li>
The class grade will be determined as follows:
<ul>
<li>
Homework and Engineering Labs: 25 percent
</li> 
<li>
Midterm Exam 1: 20 percent
</li>
<li>
Midterm Exam 2: 20 percent
</li>
<li>
Final Exam: 35 percent
<br>
</li>
</ul>
</ul>

The Engineering Labs will be counted towards your HW grade as follows: 
<br>
- You have to complete the preparatory module before the deadline, and 
<br>
- You have 
to attend to the presentation in the TA session (presence will be taken). 
<br>
This earns you 10 points per lab, 
in the same way as a 
regular HW assignment.

<br>
<br> 
 

The range of letter grades to be distributed is as follows:

<br>
<br>

A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D, F

<br>
<br>

A curve will be applied that is adapted to the outcome of each midterm exam,
and the same is true for the final exam.
