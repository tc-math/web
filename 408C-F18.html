<h3  style="color:#990000">COURSE DESCRIPTION AND PREREQUISITES</h3> 

The syllabus for M408C includes most of the basic topics in the theory of 
functions of a real variable: 
<br>
Algebraic, trigonometric, logarithmic and exponential functions and their limits, continuity, derivatives, maxima and minima, integration, area under a curve, and volumes of revolution.

<br>
<br>

This course carries the <b>Quantitative Reasoning flag</b>. Quantitative Reasoning courses are designed to equip you with skills that are necessary for understanding the types of quantitative arguments you will regularly encounter in your adult and professional life. You should therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from your use of quantitative skills to analyze real-world problems.
 
<br>
<br>

For information on prerequisites, please see 
<a href="https://www.ma.utexas.edu/academics/courses/syllabi/M408C.php">here</a>.
