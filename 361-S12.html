M361 consists of a study of the properties of complex analytic functions. Students are mainly from physics and engineering, with some mathematics majors and joint majors. Representative topics are Cauchy's integral theorem and formula, Laurent expansions, residue theory and the calculation of definite integrals, analytic continuation, and asymptotic expansions. Rigorous proofs are given for most results, with the intent to provide the student with a reliable grasp of the results and techniques.

<br>
<br>

The prerequisite is M427K or M427L with a grade of at least C-, or consent of the instructor.
