HOMEWORK  
</H3>

There will be weekly homework assignments posted on
<a href="https://quest.cns.utexas.edu/">Quest</a>.


<br>
<br>

To submit, you must enter your answers in <a href="https://quest.cns.utexas.edu/">Quest</a>.
The usual format will be multiple choice. 
<br>
Quest will immediately tell you if your answer is correct or not. 
You are allowed multiple tries, but there will be a reduction of points after each
unsuccessful attempt.

<b><a href="https://www.ma.utexas.edu/academics/undergraduate/calculus-lab/">
CalcLab</a></b> is an "office hour pool". It is a space that will operate for twenty-five hours per week, from 2 PM until 7 PM Monday through Friday, starting on September 2, 2014. 
<br>
It will always be staffed by several TAs and LAs (undergraduate Learning Assistants). 
<br>
Students from any calculus class can come to <b>CalcLab</b> whenever it is open, to get assistance with homework, test preparation, etc. 

<br>
<br>

<b>CalcLab</b> schedule (with a few exceptions announced 
<a href="https://www.ma.utexas.edu/academics/undergraduate/calculus-lab/">here</a>):

<H3 style="color:#990000">TUTORING</H3>

The UT Learning Center offers tutoring services to calculus students. Some resources are posted online on their
<a href="http://www.utexas.edu/student/utlc/learning resources/">webpage</a>.

<br>
<br>

UTLC also offers Drop-In Tutoring, a free, walk-in study environment supported by mathematics tutors.
<br> 
Additionally, they offer appointment tutoring, consisting of one hour, individualizing tutoring sessions for a fee.
