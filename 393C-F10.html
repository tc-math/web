<H3>GRADING</H3> 
Homework will be assigned regularly.  Students are encouraged to work in groups; however, each
student must write up his or her own work.  
<br>
A midterm exam, and a final exam will be given.  The course
grade will be based on the homework grade and the two exam grades.

<br>
<br>
<br>
