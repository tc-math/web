<H3>COURSE INFORMATION</H3>

Partial differential equations as basic models of flows, diffusion, dispersion, and vibrations. Topics include first- and second-order partial differential equations and classification (particularly the wave, diffusion, and potential equations), and their origins in applications and properties of solutions. Includes the study of characteristics, maximum principles, Green's functions, eigenvalue problems, and Fourier expansion methods. Prerequisite: Mathematics 427K with a grade of at least C.

HOMEWORK  
</H3>

There will be weekly homework assignments posted here. Additional course material will be posted on 
<a href="https://courses.utexas.edu/webapps/portal/frameset.jsp">Blackboard</a>.

<H3>
GRADING
</H3>

The class grade will be determined as follows:

<br>
<br>

Homework: 10 percent

<br>

Exam 1: 25 percent

<br>

Exam 2: 25 percent

<br>

Final Exam: 40 percent

<br>
<br>
  
 

Class attendance is required. This is a difficult course that will necessitate a significant investment of time and effort.
<br>
If you don't keep track of the material as we go along and stay up to date, you will not be able to catch up later.
