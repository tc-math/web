<h3  style="color:#990000">COURSE DESCRIPTION AND PREREQUISITES</h3> 

The syllabus for M408C includes most of the basic topics in the theory of 
functions of a real variable: 
<br>
Algebraic, trigonometric, logarithmic and exponential functions and their limits, continuity, derivatives, maxima and minima, integration, area under a curve, and volumes of revolution.

<br>
<br>

This course carries the <b>Quantitative Reasoning flag</b>. Quantitative Reasoning courses are designed to equip you with skills that are necessary for understanding the types of quantitative arguments you will regularly encounter in your adult and professional life. You should therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from your use of quantitative skills to analyze real-world problems.
 
<br>
<br>

For information on prerequisites, please see 
<a href="https://www.ma.utexas.edu/academics/courses/syllabi/M408C.php">here</a>.

<br>

For important dates, please see the

<br>
<br>

To submit, you must enter your answers in <a href="https://quest.cns.utexas.edu/">Quest</a>.
The usual format will be multiple choice. 
<br>
Quest will immediately tell you if your answer is correct or not. 
You are allowed multiple tries, but there will be a reduction of points after each
unsuccessful attempt.

<H3  style="color:#990000"><a id="CalcLab">OFFICE HOURS @ CALCLAB</a></H3>

<b><a href="https://www.ma.utexas.edu/academics/undergraduate/calculus-lab/">
CalcLab</a></b> is an "office hour pool" which operates for approximately
twenty-five hours per week, 
from Monday through Friday, starting on August 31, 2015.

<br>
<br>

For the detailed <b>weekly schedule</b>, please click

<br>
<br>

It will always be staffed by several graduate TAs and undergraduate LAs 
(Learning Assistants). 
<br>
Students from any calculus class can come to <b>CalcLab</b> whenever it is open, 
to get assistance with homework, test preparation, etc.

<H3 style="color:#990000">TUTORING</H3>

The UT Learning Center offers tutoring services to calculus students. Some resources are posted online on their
<a href="http://www.utexas.edu/student/utlc/learning resources/">webpage</a>.

<br>
<br>

UTLC also offers Drop-In Tutoring, a free, walk-in study environment supported by mathematics tutors.
<br> 
Additionally, they offer appointment tutoring, consisting of one hour, individualizing tutoring sessions for a fee.

<H3 style="color:#990000"><a id="Exams">EXAMS</a></H3>

There will be two in-class exams on the following dates, 
during regular class hours, in the usual lecture room: 
 
<br>

<ul>

<li>
<H3>
<b style="color:#990000">MIDTERM EXAM I</b> on Tuesday, September 29, 2015.

</H3>
</li>

</ul>   

Please save these dates, <b>there will absolutely be no make-up exams !
</b>
<br>
Should you miss a midterm exam, your grade for the final exam will be used for it. However, this policy does not apply retroactively (the final does not replace a midterm that you did submit).
  
<br>
<br> 

The final exam is <a href="http://registrar.utexas.edu/schedules/159/finals">
scheduled by the University</a>. Please note that the dates depend on the 
unique numbers !

</ul> 

<b>
It is implicit in your registration for this class that, barring some unforeseen calamity, 
you affirm to be present to take the final examination at this time.
</b>

<br>
<br>

For all exams, the format is multiple choice with no partial credits.

<H3 style="color:#990000">
GRADING
</H3>


 


<ul>

 

<li>
The class grade will be determined as follows:
<ul>
<li>
Homework and Engineering Labs: 15 percent
</li> 
<li>
Exam 1: 20 percent
</li>
<li>
Exam 2: 20 percent
</li>
<li>
Final Exam: 45 percent
<br>
</li>
</ul>
</ul>

The Engineering Labs will be counted towards your HW grade as follows: 
<br>
- You have to complete the preparatory module, and 
<br>
- You have 
to attend to the presentation in the TA session (presence will be taken). 
<br>
This earns you 10 points per lab, 
in the same way as a 
regular HW assignment.

<br>
<br> 
 

The range of letter grades to be distributed is as follows:

<br>
<br>

A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D, F

<br>
<br>

A curve will be applied that is adapted to the outcome of each midterm exam,
and the same is true for the final exam.
